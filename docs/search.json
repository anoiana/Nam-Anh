Its illustration in R will be pored over latter.\nNumerical integration\nSome summary statistics of interest can be written as integrals, so they can be approximated by summations. For example, expectation, variance and proportions of a distribution can be written as follows\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Bbb{E}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y}) &= \\int \\theta_1p(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y})d\\theta \\\\\n\\Bbb{V}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y}) &= \\int [\\theta - \\Bbb{E}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y})]^2p(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y})d\\theta \\\\\n\\Bbb{P}(\\theta > c|\\boldsymbol{Y}) &= \\int_c^{\\infty}p(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y})d\\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\nAll three measures in (2) can be rewritten as \\(\\Bbb{E}[g(\\theta)]\\), for example, \\(\\Bbb{P}(\\theta > c| \\boldsymbol{Y})\\) is equivalent to\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\large\\unicode{x1D7D9}}_{\\theta > c}(\\theta)p(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y})d\\theta\n\\]\nSince integration can be approximated by summation, \\(\\Bbb{E}[g(\\theta)] = \\int_{\\Theta}g(\\theta)p(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{Y})\\) is equivalent to\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^m g(\\theta_j)W_j,\n\\]\nwhere \\(W_j\\) is the weight given to the grid point \\(j\\).\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nMonte Carlo (MC) methods are appealing since they mimic the process of statistical concept where a sample is used to draw inferences of population. Two well-known measures are first two moments of distribution, i.e.Â \\(\\Bbb{E}(X)\\) and \\(\\Bbb{E}(X^2)\\).\n\n\n\n",
