To this end, one employs rjags which is popular for obtaining samples from posterior distribution in Bayesian framework.\nIt is worth noting that the generalized \\(t\\) distribution function dt in rjags requires mean and precision rather than location and scale as its parameters. For example, one simulates samples from a generalized \\(t\\) distribution whose mean and variance are 10 and 0.5, one shall need to plug in values of 10 and 1/0.5 as its first two parameters (third parameter is degree of freedom which equals 4).\n\n\nhide\n\nmodel_string <- textConnection(\n  \"model{\n Y ~ dt(10,2,4)\n}\")\nmodel <- jags.model(model_string, n.chains = 1, quiet = T)\n#update(model, 1000, progress.bar=\"none\")\nparams <- c(\"Y\")\nsamples <- coda.samples(model,\n                        variable.names=params,\n                        n.iter=1000, progress.bar=\"none\")\n\n##################\nx = samples[[1]][,1] %>% sort()\n\n\n\nLet us compare with samples obtained by R function\n\n\nhide\n\ncurve(wiqid::dt3(x,10, sqrt(0.5),4), xlim = c(0,20), lty = 3,, ylab = \"density\")\npoints(x,wiqid::dt3(x,10,sqrt(0.5),4), col = \"red\", type = \"l\", lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Transformation\nOne sometimes requires simulating samples from a transformed random variable, i.e one generates \\(Y = (2Z+1)^3\\), where \\(Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) and calculate \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y)\\) and \\(\\mathbb{P}(Y \\ge10)\\).

The term inf or infimum is also called the greatest lower bound, this is, the greatest point of lower bound set. We can see that all black filled circle are less than \\(-1\\), so all of them can be deemed lower bound of the collection of red filled circles, and a point corresponding \\(n\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) is the greatest point. By definition, this is called infimum or the greatest lower bound.\n1.2 \\(\\lim\\sup\\)\nSimilarly,\nIf \\((b_n)\\) is bounded and decreasing, it has a limit called \\(b\\). We can define the so-called \\(\\lim\\sup\\) of such a sequence as follows \\[\n\\lim_n\\sup(c_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sup\\{c_k: k \\ge n\\}.\n\\]\nThe following figure illustrates for sup or supremum\n\n\nhide\n\nset.seed(200)\nr = runif(100,0,1)\nplot(d[d[,2]>0,], pch = 16, cex = 1.2, ylab = \"sequence (c)\", ylim = c(0,3.5),type = \"o\")\npoints(r, pch = 16, col = \"red\")\nabline(h = 1, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: example for \\(\\lim\\sup\\)\n\n\n\nIn this case, all black filled circles are greater than \\(1\\), the sequence goes to \\(1\\) as \\(n\\) approaches to \\(\\infty\\) (never reach \\(1\\)). Thus, they are upper bounds of the collection of red filled circles. Also, a point corresponding \\(n\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) is the least point of the upper bound set. This is called supremum or the least upper bound.\nIf we combine both figures, we obtain\n\n\nhide\n\nset.seed(200)\nr = runif(500,-1,1)\nplot(d[d[,2]<0,], pch = 16, ylim = c(-6,6), cex = 0.7, ylab = \"sequence (c)\", type = \"o\")\npoints(d[d[,2]>0,], pch = 16, cex = 0.7, ylab = \"sequence (c)\", ylim = c(0,3.5), type = \"o\")\npoints(r, pch = 16, col = \"red\")\nabline(h = c(-1,1), col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: example for \\(\\lim\\sup\\)\n\n\n\nTwo horizontal red lines represent for \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\), and when \\(n\\) goes to \\(\\infty\\) they approach to \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), respectively. If we extend the interval \\([-1,1]\\) to a general interval \\([a,b]\\), then \\([a_{n+1},b_{n+1}]\\) will be contained in \\([a_n,b_n]\\) for all \\(n\\). We can say \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}[a_n,b_n] = [-1,1]\\). This is, as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) it approaches to the shortest length interval of \\([a_n,b_n]_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\).\nWe can also express the above idea by intersection, ie., the intersection of all intervals \\([a_n,b_n]_{n = 1,2,\\dots}\\) is \\([a,b] \\equiv [-1,1]\\). In other words, intersection can be utilized to express the “smallest” magnitude of length, area, volume, etc. This idea can be extended to limits of sets.\n2 \\(\\lim\\sup\\) and \\(\\lim\\inf\\) of a sequence of sets\nLet \\(A_n \\subset \\Omega\\), we define\n\\[\n\\inf_{k \\ge n}A_k := \\bigcap_{k=n}^{\\infty}A_k; \\quad \\sup_{k \\ge n}A_k := \\bigcup_{k=n}^{\\infty}A_k\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\nthus,\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\inf A_n = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\bigcap_{k=n}^{\\infty}A_k, \\\\\n&\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sup A_n = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\bigcup_{k=n}^{\\infty}A_k\n\\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo get the intuition about \\(\\lim\\sup\\) and \\(\\lim\\inf\\) in term of union and intersection, let us consider Eq.(1) in details. We will consider the case of intersection, second case can be explained in the same way.\nSuppose \\(n= 10\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&B_1 = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{10}A_i \\\\\n&B_2 = \\bigcap_{i=2}^{10}A_i \\\\\n&\\quad \\dots \\\\\n&B_9 = A_9 \\cap A_{10} \\\\\n&B_{10} = A_{10}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nhence we can conclude\n\\[\nB_1 \\le B_2 \\le \\dots \\le B_{10}\n\\]\nand hence \\(B_n\\) is an increasing sequence, so it has a limit. What we need is to find a set that corresponds to greatest lower bound. It is NOT akin to the sequence of real numbers, The sequence of sets i.e., the magnitude of sets is determined by the intersection and union of all available sets. Thus, to find the greatest set, we can’t only compare among \\(\\{B_i\\}_{i=1}^{10}\\), but we also compare all intersections and unions among \\(\\{B_i\\}_{i=1}^{10}\\). To this end, the greatest set is\n\\[\n\\bigcup_{i=1}^{10}B_i = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{10}\\bigcap_{i=n}^{10}A_i,\n\\]\nwhich has a general form in Eq.(2). The case of supremum can be explained with an analogous manner. To this end, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&B_1 = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{10}A_i \\\\\n&B_2 = \\bigcup_{i=2}^{10}A_i \\\\\n&\\quad \\dots \\\\\n&B_9 = A_9 \\cup A_{10} \\\\\n&B_{10} = A_{10}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and then \\[\nB_1 \\ge B_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge B_{10}\n\\]\nhence \\(B_n\\) is an decreasing sequence and it has a limit. With an analogous manner, we can obtain the smallest set that is \\[\n\\bigcap_{i=1}^{10}B_i = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{10}\\bigcup_{i=n}^{10}A_i.\n\\] which is second equation in Eq.(2).\n\n\n\n",

In fact, state \\(\\{y_{s}\\}_{s=2}^5\\) is often defined as the utilities equivalent to a scenario in which perfect health is obtained with probability \\(\\pi_s = u(y_s,t)\\).\nUsing the law of total probability we obtain the chance of preferred consequence \\(y_1\\) as follows\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{P}(y_1|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t) &= \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1^t + \\sum_{s=2}^5\\pi_s\\mathbb{P}(y_s|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t)\n\\\\&= \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1^t+ \\sum_{s=1}^5\\pi_s\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_s^t\n\\\\&=\\sum_{s=1}^5u(y_s,t)\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_s^t\n\\\\&= \\mathbb{E}[u(Y,t)]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\nIn practice, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t\\) always involves uncertainty, so we will need to consider \\(p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t|\\mathcal{D})\\), where \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is the background information. The implication of Eq.(1) is that the probability of obtaining the preferred options amounts to the expectation of utility function, more commonly referred to as the expected utility denoting \\(\\mathcal{U}^t\\). Thus, the optimal decision criterion is to maximize the expected utility, i.e.\n\n\\[\nt^* = \\arg\\max_{\\mathcal{T}}\\mathcal{U}^t\n\\]\n\nAlso, we can generalize Eq.(1) as follows\n\\[\n\\mathcal{U}^t = \\int_{\\Theta}\\int_{\\mathcal{Y}} u(y,t)p(y|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t)p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t|\\mathcal{D})dyd\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^t\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n2 The setup of decision-making in health economics\n2.1 Statistical framework\nLet \\(t \\in \\mathcal{T}:= \\{0,1\\}\\) be a set of interventions and \\(y_i\\) outcome of \\(i^{th}\\) subject which is constituted by effectiveness and cost, i.e. \\(y = (e,c)\\). Also, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_0,\\theta_1)^{\\top}\\) is the vector of parameters of interest. First, we aim to find the conditional distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) given data, i.e. posterior distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{D}_t = \\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{n_t}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\bigcup_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}}\\mathcal{D}_t\\), so the posterior has the form \\(p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})\\). In the second step, therefore, we are interested in predictive model which can be obtained by simulation.\nFor example, suppose that \\(\\pi_1\\) and \\(\\pi_0\\) are probabilities that a patient is treated by active treatment and placebo, respectively, and \\(\\pi_1 = \\pi_0\\rho\\) where \\(\\rho\\) is the measure of difference, i.e absolute or relative difference. Conditionally on \\(\\pi_t\\), \\(\\gamma\\) is the probability of needing ambulatory care and \\(1-\\gamma\\) is the probability a patient requires hospital admission.\nWe take the sample size of \\(N =1000\\) and the number of patients experiencing side effect is \\(SE_t \\sim \\mathcal{Bin}(\\pi_t,N)\\); the number of patients requiring ambulatory care is \\(A_t \\sim \\mathcal{Bin}(\\gamma,SE_t)\\), and hence the number of patients with side effects requring hospital admission is \\(H_t = SE_t-A_t\\). Also, \\(c_t^{drug}\\) is a fixed cost value and \\(c^{hosp}\\) and \\(c^{amb}\\) are costs of ambulatory care and hospital admission, such two costs are independent. We now modify the parameters of interest as \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1)\\) where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0 = (\\pi_0,\\gamma,c^{amb},c^{hosp})\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1 = (\\pi_1,\\gamma,c^{amb},c^{hosp})\\). Therefore, condition on \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) the observable outcome is \\(Y = (SE_t,A_t,H_t)\\).\n2.2 Decision process\nSuppose an intervention \\(t\\) is applied and we obtain the outcome \\(y\\). Thus, we can quantify by combining a clinical effectiveness \\(e\\) of the outcome \\(y\\) and the costs \\(c\\) associated with intervention \\(t\\), for each \\((y,t)\\) we associate \\((e,c)\\). We now let\n\\[\n\\Delta_e := \\mathbb{E}(e|\\theta_1) - \\mathbb{E}(e|\\theta_0), \\text{ and}\\quad \\Delta_c:=\\mathbb{E}(c|\\theta_1) - \\mathbb{E}(c|\\theta_0)\n\\]\nare the increment in the mean effectiveness and the increment in the mean cost. Obviously, these two functions are the function of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). Recall that we aim to find \\(\\mathcal{U}^*:= \\max\\mathcal{U}_t\\), i.e. we choose \\(t=1\\) if\n\\[\nEIB:= \\mathcal{U}_1 - \\mathcal{U}_0 > 0\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\nthus,\n\\[\n\\mathcal{U}^* = \\max\\{EIB,0\\}+\\mathcal{U}_0.\n\\]\n2.3 Choosing a utility function: The net benefit\nTo obtain Eq.(2) we will need to a pre-defined function of utility \\(u(y,t)\\) through \\(e\\) and \\(c\\), the net benefit, for example,\n\\[\nu(y,t) = ke-c,\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is a willingness-to-pay parameter used to put the cost and benefit on the same scale, and it is the budget the decision-maker is willing to pay to upgrade the benefits by one unit. Let us review the relationship among aforementioned measures:\n\nThe expected incremental benefit: \\(EIB:=\\mathcal{U}_t-\\mathcal{U}_0\\);\nThe expected utility \\(\\mathcal{U}_t = \\mathbb{E}[u(y,t)]\\);\n\\(u(y,t) = ke-c\\)\n\\(\\Delta_e:= \\mathbb{E}(e|\\theta_1)-\\mathbb{E}(e|\\theta_0)\\), and \\(\\Delta_c:= \\mathbb{E}(c|\\theta_1) - \\mathbb{E}(c|\\theta_0)\\)\n\nThus,\n\\[\nEIB = \\mathbb{E}(k\\Delta_e-\\Delta_c) = k\\mathbb{E}(\\Delta_e) - \\mathbb{E}(\\Delta_c),\n\\tag{4}\n\\]\nand because \\(\\Delta_e\\) and \\(\\Delta_c\\) are expectations of \\(e|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) and \\(c|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), by total of expectation, \\(EIB\\) is an expectation on distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). Let us divide both sides of Eq.(4) and arrange terms we obtain\n\\[\nk = \\frac{EIB+\\mathbb{E}(\\Delta_c)}{\\mathbb{E}(\\Delta_e)} = \\frac{EIB}{\\mathbb{E}(\\Delta_e)}+ICER\n\\]\nthus,\n\\[\nICER = k-\\frac{EIB}{\\mathbb{E}(\\Delta_e)}\n\\]\nif \\(EIB >0\\) (by Eq.(3) this is the condition we expect to see), we have\n\\[\nICER < k,\n\\]\nso interventions having the \\(ICER\\) is less than the willing-to-pay threshold are deemed cost-effective.\nAlso, we will need to define an appropriate measures of the cost and effectiveness. The total cost relative to each treatment can be added up the cost of each patient, i.e\n\\[\nc_t := c_t^{drug}(N-SE_t)+ (c_t^{drug}+c^{amb})A_t+(c_t^{drug}+c^{hosp})H_t.\n\\]\nAs for the measure of effectiveness, we count the number of patients who do not experience side effects\n\\[\ne_t:= N-SE_t.\n\\]\n3 The value of information (VoI)\n3.1 Motivation\nWe shall consider the following table\n\n\nhide\n\ntab1<-\ntibble(decision = c(\"d1\",\"d2\",\"d3\",\"probability\"),\n       `state 1` = c(12,15,5,0.5),\n       `state 2` = c(9,11,18,0.2), \n       `state 3` = c(13,8,10,0.3)\n       )\nMyTable(tab1, \"current information.\")\n\n\n\nTable 1: current information.\n\n\ndecision\n\n\nstate 1\n\n\nstate 2\n\n\nstate 3\n\n\nd1\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n13.0\n\n\nd2\n\n\n15.0\n\n\n11.0\n\n\n8.0\n\n\nd3\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n18.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\nprobability\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.3\n\n\nand two measures expected value with perfect information (EVwPI) and expected value without perfect information (EVwoPI), which are defined as follows\n\\[\nEVwPI = \\max\\mathbb{E}(S);\n\\tag{5}\n\\] \\[\nEVwoPI = \\mathbb{E}[\\max(S)].\n\\tag{6}\n\\]\nHence, we obtain \\(\\mathbb{E}(S)\\) for \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\) and \\(d_3\\) are\n\n\nhide\n\nexp_s<-\nsapply(tab1[-4,-1], function(x) as.matrix(tab1[4,-1])%*%x)\nexp_s\n\n\nstate 1 state 2 state 3 \n   10.5    12.1    11.1 \n\nso \\(\\max\\mathbb{E}(S)=\\) 12.1.
